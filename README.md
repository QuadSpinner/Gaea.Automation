# The Gaea Automation Library
An open source repository for Gaea automation-friendly files, and related resources.

This repository contains official and user-contributed TOR files for [QuadSpinner Gaea](https://quadspinner.com/gaea) that can be used for command line automation, or in conjunction with bridges to 3rd party applications such as SideFX Houdini.

For usage with specific applications, see [Using Automation Recipes](...).

To contribute your own recipes, see [Contributing Recipes](...).

WORK-IN-PROGRESS - more information and resources will be added to this repo soon.
